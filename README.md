# Breast-Cancer-Diagnostic-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression
This project leverages the well-known Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset to develop a high-accuracy binary classification model. The core methodology involves aggressive **feature standardization** and the application of a **Logistic Regression** classifier, chosen for its speed, and robust performance on linearly separable data.
